I have more than 12 years of industry experience in technology, product, and engineering management with solid know-how in adopting software methodologies, agility, and innovation. As a tech entrepreneur, I am capable of transforming business needs from C-Level, Investors, and Customers, into technical products. I have founded two startups, one of which was sold to an industry leader.

I have management and hands-on experience with various areas and technologies: network protocols, system design, distributed systems, cloud, and mobile. Additionally, I possess unique knowledge of network coding techniques. I love to build ground-breaking solutions from scratch, with a focus on performance and scalability. I led cross-functional teams towards concrete objectives, focused on delivery with quality, especially under conditions of uncertainty. I am always interested in embracing new challenges in complex environments, involving different stakeholders. I am results-oriented, creative, hands-on, and a decision-maker by nature.

I love technology, problem-solving is in my heart and aviation is my passion. I am always eager to learn new things.
